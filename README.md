My first Django test project
Hello world, this is a test project that you can run on your own machine. To create and run this project, I used:
-Python ver 3.10.5
-Django ver 4.0.5
After installing python and django, copy the code to your interpreter and run the command in the terminal:
-python manage.py runserver
The server has been successfully launched, copy the url to your browser and enjoy the project =)
